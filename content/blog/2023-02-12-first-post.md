Working on setting up the blog. So far my experience with Gridsome has been pretty sweet. Everything has been very easy to set up and configure so far. I may come back and edit this post in the future but this satisfies the ability to add a blog page for now.

## Update
Just going to try some different content here and see what it looks like.

Here is a list:
 - List item 1
 - List item 2
 - Buckle my Shoe :)

Here is a link [Link](https://example.com). This is fine-ish for now.

```js
    <template>
        <h1>Testing out the code block formatting</h1>
        <p>I hope this looks cool</p>
    </template>
    <script type="text/js">
    export default {
        data() {
            return {
                cool: true,
            }
        }
    }
    </script>
```
