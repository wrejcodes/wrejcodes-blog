## New look

While not the most robust or interesting of styles, this will at least be a decent starting point. I plan on making the site more pretty over time but this will do for now.

## Projects

I also added a section where I can talk about projects I'm working on. I might post some code there or links to things if I publish them. It seems like a cool area to show off work.
